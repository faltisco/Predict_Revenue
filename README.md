# Predict_Revenue

How can the movie properties form a model that predicts success in terms of profit for a movie? That is, given Kaggle data from TMDB (https://www.kaggle.com/rfaltisco/tmdb-prediction/edit), what are the best predictive variables? Is it always true that high budget movies have the greatest chances for making the most money?  By analyzing movie data, and modeling with revenue as the target, the TMDB/Kaggle data will be analyzed via xgboost.  Perhaps, if time permitts, a near future movieâ€™s release will coincide with the timeline of this project, and the model will be used to predict its success.
